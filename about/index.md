Hi, that's me, I work as a Linux System Administrator in Devon.

This site is just the output from an afternoon playing about with static site engines, and utilising AWS technologies to make it completely 'serverless'. 
I am learning as I go, so please forgive the lack of HTTPS or elastic scaling for now. ;)

Here's a link to [my github](http://github.com/kernow5000) if you want to see some 15yr old code, 
that runs on the Sega Dreamcast :)

I'll put some more stuff here soon, but for now here's what I'm into:

* Linux, CentOS, Docker, Ansible
* AWS things
* Automation and decoupling
* Record collecting, Hi-Fi, and Japanese videogames and transformers. :)

If you're interested more in my skills, you can [find my CV here]({{ site.url }}/assets/Shaun Bradley.pdf).

Thanks for looking!

Shaun
