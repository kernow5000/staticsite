It's a Bank Holiday in the UK, which means I've got the day off. I've got all week off however so that's nice. 
I'm going to update and tidy this blog a bit, and the build process. 

Not to mention now it's set up I can create a low privileged IAM keypair in AWS that can only upload to an S3 bucket. 
This means you can use that credential set to push new blog posts with little to no privileges at all. 

Other than that, I'm going to town to buy a new kettle, and doing some laundry. 

Exciting times!
