I've literally just set this site up in about 10 minutes. I have been investigating hosting static sites on Amazons S3 service, 
and have found it's very good for static content. I am now using the Jekyll static site engine or whatever it is to push this site up to S3.

I'll write a better post about this later with some sketches, but it costs me about 56p a month to host this site, and that's including the DNS for the domain.

It is how you say, very 2017 and 'serverless'

;)


### So, what am I going to use this for?

Mainly just little bits of code, thoughts, and stuff like that. 

*By the way, every page after this is just the default ones, so ..*

Stay tuned!
